# Frontend Styling Guidelines

## Tailwind CSS

### Best Practices

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Implement Just-in-Time (JIT) mode for development efficiency and smaller CSS bundles
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Leverage the @apply directive in component classes to reuse utility combinations
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Use component extraction for repeated UI patterns instead of copying utility classes
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

## shadcn/ui Integration

### Component Library

- Use shadcn/ui components from the shared `packages/ui` workspace
- Customize components through Tailwind classes rather than modifying source
- Extend the theme in `tailwind.config.js` for brand colors and design tokens
- Use CSS variables for theme colors to support light/dark mode switching
- Leverage composition to create domain-specific components from shadcn/ui primitives

### Design System

- Define consistent spacing scale in Tailwind config (4px base unit)
- Use semantic color names (primary, secondary, destructive, etc.)
- Implement consistent border radius and shadow scales
- Use consistent typography scale with proper line heights
- Define animation timing functions and durations in config
