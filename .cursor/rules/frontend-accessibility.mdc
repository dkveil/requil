# Accessibility Guidelines

## ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

### Semantic HTML First

- Use ARIA landmarks to identify regions of the page (main, navigation, search, etc.)
- Apply appropriate ARIA roles to custom interface elements that lack semantic HTML equivalents
- Set aria-expanded and aria-controls for expandable content like accordions and dropdowns
- Use aria-live regions with appropriate politeness settings for dynamic content updates
- Implement aria-hidden to hide decorative or duplicative content from screen readers
- Apply aria-label or aria-labelledby for elements without visible text labels
- Use aria-describedby to associate descriptive text with form inputs or complex elements
- Implement aria-current for indicating the current item in a set, navigation, or process
- Avoid redundant ARIA that duplicates the semantics of native HTML elements
- Apply aria-invalid and appropriate error messaging for form validation in {{form_validation}}

## WCAG Perceivable

### Visual Design

- Provide text alternatives for non-text content including images, icons, and graphics with appropriate alt attributes
- Ensure pre-recorded audio-visual content has captions, audio descriptions, and transcripts for {{media_content}}
- Maintain minimum contrast ratios of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text and UI components
- Enable content to be presented in different ways without losing information or structure when zoomed or resized
- Avoid using color alone to convey information; pair with text, patterns, or icons for {{status_indicators}}
- Provide controls to pause, stop, or hide any moving, blinking, or auto-updating content
- Ensure text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality in {{responsive_layouts}}
- Use responsive design that adapts to different viewport sizes and zoom levels without horizontal scrolling
- Enable users to customize text spacing (line height, paragraph spacing, letter/word spacing) without breaking layouts

## Mobile Accessibility

### Touch & Interaction

- Ensure touch targets are at least 44 by 44 pixels for comfortable interaction on mobile devices
- Implement proper viewport configuration to support pinch-to-zoom and prevent scaling issues
- Design layouts that adapt to both portrait and landscape orientations without loss of content
- Support both touch and keyboard navigation for hybrid devices with {{input_methods}}
- Ensure interactive elements have sufficient spacing to prevent accidental activation
- Test with mobile screen readers like VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)
- Design forms that work efficiently with on-screen keyboards and autocomplete functionality
- Implement alternatives to complex gestures that require fine motor control
- Ensure content is accessible when device orientation is locked for users with fixed devices
- Provide alternatives to motion-based interactions for users with vestibular disorders

## Dashboard-Specific Considerations

- Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions (save template, preview, send test)
- Use proper focus management in modal dialogs and multi-step forms
- Provide skip links to main content areas
- Announce dynamic status updates (email sent, validation errors) to screen readers
- Ensure the template editor is keyboard navigable with proper focus indicators
- Provide text alternatives for visual email preview renders
