# React Guidelines

## React Coding Standards

### Component Architecture

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Leverage Server Components for {{data_fetching_heavy_components}} when using React with Next.js or similar frameworks
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

## State Management

### Zustand (Recommended for Dashboard)

- Create separate stores for distinct state domains instead of one large store
- Use immer middleware for complex state updates to maintain immutability when dealing with nested data
- Implement selectors to derive state and prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Leverage the persist middleware for automatic state persistence in localStorage or other storage
- Use TypeScript with strict typing for store definitions to catch errors at compile time
- Prefer shallow equality checks with useShallow for performance optimization in component re-renders
- Combine stores using composition for sharing logic between stores
- Implement subscriptions to react to state changes outside of React components
- Use devtools middleware for Redux DevTools integration in development
- Create custom hooks to encapsulate store access and related business logic

### Redux Toolkit (Alternative)

- Use Redux Toolkit (RTK) instead of plain Redux to reduce boilerplate code
- Implement the slice pattern for organizing related state, reducers, and actions
- Use RTK Query for data fetching to eliminate manual loading state management
- Prefer createSelector for memoized selectors to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- Normalize complex state structures using a flat entities approach with IDs as references
- Implement middleware selectively and avoid overusing thunks for simple state updates
- Use the listener middleware for complex side effects instead of thunks where appropriate
- Leverage createEntityAdapter for standardized CRUD operations
- Implement Redux DevTools for debugging in development environments
- Use typed hooks (useAppDispatch, useAppSelector) with TypeScript for type safety

## Data Fetching

### TanStack Query (React Query)

- Use TanStack Query (formerly React Query) with appropriate staleTime and gcTime based on data freshness requirements
- Implement the useInfiniteQuery hook for pagination and infinite scrolling
- Use optimistic updates for mutations to make the UI feel more responsive
- Leverage queryClient.setQueryDefaults to establish consistent settings for query categories
- Use suspense mode with <Suspense> boundaries for a more declarative data fetching approach
- Implement retry logic with custom backoff algorithms for transient network issues
- Use the select option to transform and extract specific data from query results
- Implement mutations with onMutate, onError, and onSettled for robust error handling
- Use Query Keys structuring pattern ([entity, params]) for better organization and automatic refetching
- Implement query invalidation strategies to keep data fresh after mutations

## Routing

### React Router (If needed)

- Use createBrowserRouter instead of BrowserRouter for better data loading and error handling
- Implement lazy loading with React.lazy() for route components to improve initial load time
- Use the useNavigate hook instead of the navigate component prop for programmatic navigation
- Leverage loader and action functions to handle data fetching and mutations at the route level
- Implement error boundaries with errorElement to gracefully handle routing and data errors
- Use relative paths with dot notation (e.g., "../parent") to maintain route hierarchy flexibility
- Utilize the useRouteLoaderData hook to access data from parent routes
- Implement fetchers for non-navigation data mutations
- Use route.lazy() for route-level code splitting with automatic loading states
- Implement shouldRevalidate functions to control when data revalidation happens after navigation
